## BlockNote Mendix Pluggable Widget
[BlockNote](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote) ðŸ“’ is an "open source Block-Based React rich text editor. Easily add a modern text editing experience to your app.". **All credits for the library go to [BlockNote](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote)'s contributors.**

The Block Note is used by [Docs](https://docs.numerique.gouv.fr/login/), a joint effort from the French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª governments, described as a way to "Collaborate and write in real time, without layout constraints". It is an alternative to Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, among others.

Now, [BlockNote](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote) is available as a Mendix Widget ðŸš€, allowing you to bring the minimalistic, yet powerful editor to your Mendix Web applications.
